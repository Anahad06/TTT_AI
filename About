This game uses the Mini-Max Algorithm to create an unbeatable AI.

How It Works? 

In game theory, the Minimax algorithm determines the best course of action. The opponent's optimal play is taken into account by the Minimax algorithm. 
In essence, we programme two AIs to play every conceivable Tic Tac Toe result, and then the AI presents the player with those results based on the best move. 

Can you beat it? 

No! It is impossible to beat.
